## How to Contribute

We strive to keep our workflow as simple as possible. To contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim-studio.git
   ```
3. **Create a Feature Branch**  
   Create a new branch with a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

   Use a clear naming convention to indicate the type of work (e.g., `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`).

4. **Make Your Changes**  
   Ensure your changes are small, focused, and adhere to our coding guidelines.

5. **Commit Your Changes**  
   Write clear, descriptive commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) specification. This allows us to maintain a coherent project history and generate changelogs automatically. For example:
   - `feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication`
   - `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
   - `docs: update contribution guidelines`
6. **Push Your Branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Open a pull request against the `main` branch on GitHub. Please provide a clear description of the changes and reference any relevant issues (e.g., `fixes #123`).

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in our GitHub repository. When opening an issue, ensure you:

- Provide a clear, descriptive title.
- Include as many details as possible (steps to reproduce, screenshots, etc.).
- **Tag Your Issue Appropriately:**  
  Use the following labels to help us categorize your issue:
  - **active:** Actively working on it right now.
  - **bug:** Something isn't working.
  - **design:** Improvements & changes to design & UX.
  - **discussion:** Initiate a discussion or propose an idea.

## Pull Request Process

Before creating a pull request:

- **Ensure Your Branch Is Up-to-Date:**  
  Rebase your branch onto the latest `main` branch to prevent merge conflicts.
- **Follow the Guidelines:**  
  Make sure your changes are well-tested, follow our coding standards, and include relevant documentation if necessary.

- **Reference Issues:**  
  If your PR addresses an existing issue, include `refs #<issue-number>` or `fixes #<issue-number>` in your PR description.

Our maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. We aim to make the review process as smooth and timely as possible.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) standard. Your commit messages should have the following format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

- **Types** may include:
  - `feat` – a new feature
  - `fix` – a bug fix
  - `docs` – documentation changes
  - `style` – code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
  - `refactor` – code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test` – adding or correcting tests
  - `chore` – changes to tooling, build process, etc.
  - `high priority` – a high priority feature or fix
  - `high risk` – a high risk feature or fix
  - `improvement` – an improvement to the codebase

_Examples:_

- `feat(auth): add social login integration`
- `fix(ui): correct misaligned button on homepage`

Using clear and consistent commit messages makes it easier for everyone to understand the project history and aids in automating changelog generation.
