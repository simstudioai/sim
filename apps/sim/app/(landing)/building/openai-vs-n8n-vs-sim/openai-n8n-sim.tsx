                When building AI agent workflows, developers often evaluate multiple platforms to
                find the right fit for their needs. Three platforms frequently come up in these
                discussions: OpenAI's new AgentKit, the established workflow automation tool n8n,
                and Sim, a purpose-built AI agent workflow builder. While all three enable AI agent
                development, they take fundamentally different approaches, each with distinct
                strengths and ideal use cases.

              <p className='mb-6 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                OpenAI AgentKit is a set of building blocks designed to help developers take AI
                agents from prototype to production. Built on top of the OpenAI Responses API, it
                provides a structured approach to building and deploying intelligent agents.

                AgentKit provides a visual canvas where developers can design and build agents. This
                interface allows you to model complex workflows visually, making it easier to
                understand and iterate on agent behavior. The builder is powered by OpenAI's
                Responses API.

                ChatKit enables developers to embed chat interfaces to run workflows directly within

                Sim is a fully open-source platform (Apache 2.0 license) specifically designed for
                AI agent development. Unlike platforms that added AI capabilities as an
                afterthought, Sim was created from the ground up to address the unique challenges of
                building, testing, and deploying production-ready AI agents.

                Sim's native knowledge base goes far beyond simple document storage. Powered by
                pgvector, it provides semantic search that understands meaning and context, not just
                keywords. Upload documents in multiple formats (PDF, Word, Excel, Markdown, and
                more), and Sim automatically processes them with intelligent chunking, generates
                vector embeddings, and makes them instantly searchable. The knowledge base supports
                natural language queries, concept-based retrieval, multi-language understanding, and
                configurable chunk sizes (100-4,000 characters). This makes building RAG agents
                straightforward—your AI can search through your organization's knowledge with
                context-aware precision.

              <p className='mb-6 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                Sim provides enterprise-grade logging that captures every detail of workflow
                execution. Track workflow runs with execution IDs, view block-level logs with
                precise timing and duration metrics, monitor token usage and costs per execution,
                and debug failures with detailed error traces and trace spans. The logging system
                integrates with Copilot—you can reference execution logs directly in your Copilot
                conversations to understand what happened and troubleshoot issues. This level of
                observability is essential for production AI agents where understanding behavior and
                debugging issues quickly is critical.

              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams deeply invested in the OpenAI ecosystem who
                prioritize evaluation and testing capabilities. Ideal when you need tight
                integration with OpenAI's latest models and want built-in prompt optimization and
                evaluation tools.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> Locked into OpenAI models only, not open-source, no
                workflow templates or execution logs, limited triggering options, and fewer
                out-of-the-box integrations.

              <h3 className='mt-6 mb-3 font-medium text-[22px] leading-tight'>n8n</h3>
              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Traditional workflow automation with some AI enhancement.
                Excellent when your primary need is connecting business tools and services, with AI
                as a complementary feature rather than the core focus.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> No SDK for programmatic workflow building, fair-use
                licensing (not fully open source), 14-day trial limitation, and AI agent
                capabilities are newer and less mature compared to its traditional automation
                features.

              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Building production-ready AI agent workflows that require
                flexibility, collaboration, and comprehensive tooling. Ideal for teams that need AI
                Copilot assistance, advanced knowledge base features, detailed logging, and the
                ability to work across multiple AI providers with purpose-built agentic workflow
                tools.
              </p>
              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> Fewer integrations than n8n's extensive library,
                though the 80+ built-in integrations and MCP protocol support cover most AI agent
                needs.

              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                Choose <strong>OpenAI AgentKit</strong> if you're exclusively using OpenAI models
                and want to build chat interfaces with the ChatKit. It's a solid choice for teams
                that want to stay within OpenAI's ecosystem and prioritize testing capabilities.
              </p>

              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                Choose <strong>n8n</strong> if your primary use case is traditional workflow
                automation between business tools, with occasional AI enhancement. It's ideal for
                organizations already familiar with n8n who want to add some AI capabilities to
                existing automations.
              </p>

              <p className='mb-4 text-[19px] text-gray-800 leading-relaxed'>
                Choose <strong>Sim</strong> if you're building AI agents as your primary objective
                and need a platform purpose-built for that use case. Sim provides the most
                comprehensive feature set for agentic workflows, with AI Copilot to accelerate
