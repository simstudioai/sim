        <p className='mb-4'>
          We offer Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise subscription plans. Paid plans include a base
          subscription fee plus usage-based charges for inference and other services that exceed
          your plan's included limits.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          You agree to pay all fees associated with your account. Your base subscription fee is
          charged at the beginning of each billing cycle (monthly or annually). Inference overages
          are charged incrementally every $50 during your billing period, which may result in
          multiple invoices within a single billing cycle. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice.
          If payment fails, we may suspend or terminate your access to paid features.

          settings or by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access
          to paid features until that time. We do not provide refunds for partial billing periods.

          assigns and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and

          You agree that any dispute between you and any of the Company Parties relating to the

          small claims court if the claims qualify, remain in such court and advance solely on an
          individual, non-class basis; and (2) you or the Company Parties may seek equitable relief
          in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
