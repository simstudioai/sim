/**
 * Features section — Sim's core product capabilities.
 *
 * SEO:
 * - `<section id="features" aria-labelledby="features-heading">`.
 * - `<h2 id="features-heading">` for the section title.
 * - Each feature: `<h3>` + `<p>` + `<ul>` capability list. Strict H2 -> H3 -> H4 hierarchy.
 * - Feature lists map to `WebApplication.featureList` in structured-data.tsx — keep in sync.
 *
 * GEO:
 * - Each feature block is independently extractable (atomic answer block pattern).
 * - Include specific numbers ("100+ integrations", "15+ AI providers", "SOC2 compliant").
 * - Always use "Sim" by name — never "the platform" or "our tool" (entity consistency).
