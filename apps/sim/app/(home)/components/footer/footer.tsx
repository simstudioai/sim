 * - Legal links (Privacy, Terms) must be crawlable (trust signals).
 *
 * GEO:
 * - Include "Sim — Build AI agents and run your agentic workforce" as visible text (entity reinforcement).
 * - Social links (X, GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord) must match `sameAs` in structured-data.tsx.
 * - Link to all major pages: Docs, Pricing, Enterprise, Careers, Changelog (internal link graph).
 * - Display compliance badges (SOC2, HIPAA) and status page link as visible trust signals.
