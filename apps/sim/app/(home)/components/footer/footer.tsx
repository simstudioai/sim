 * Landing page footer — navigation, legal links, and entity reinforcement.
 *
 * SEO:
 * - `<footer role="contentinfo">` with `<nav aria-label="Footer navigation">`.
 * - Link groups under semantic headings (`<h3>`). All links are `<Link>` or `<a>` with `href`.
 * - External links include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
 * - Legal links (Privacy, Terms) must be crawlable (trust signals).
 *
 * GEO:
 * - Include "Sim — Open-source AI agent workflow builder" as visible text (entity reinforcement).
 * - Social links (X, GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord) must match `sameAs` in structured-data.tsx.
 * - Link to all major pages: Docs, Pricing, Enterprise, Careers, Changelog (internal link graph).
 * - Display compliance badges (SOC2, HIPAA) and status page link as visible trust signals.
