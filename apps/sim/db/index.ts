 * Connection Pool Allocation Strategy

 * Main App (this file): 3 connections per instance
 * Socket Server Operations: 2 connections
 * Socket Server Room Manager: 1 connection
 *
 * With ~3-4 Vercel serverless instances typically active:
 * - Main app: 3 Ã— 4 = 12 connections
 * - Socket server: 2 + 1 = 3 connections
 * - Buffer: 5 connections for spikes/other services
 * - Total: ~20 connections (at capacity limit)
 *
 * This conservative allocation prevents pool exhaustion while maintaining performance.
