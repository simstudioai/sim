Tools are powerful components in Sim Studio that allow your workflows to interact with external services, process data, and perform specialized tasks. They extend the capabilities of your agents and workflows by providing access to various APIs and services.

## What is a Tool?

A tool is a specialized component that provides a specific functionality or integration with external services. Tools can be used to search the web, interact with databases, process images, generate text or images, communicate via messaging platforms, and much more.

## Using Tools in Workflows

There are two primary ways to use tools in your Sim Studio workflows:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>As Standalone Blocks</strong>: Tools can be added as individual
    blocks on the canvas when you need deterministic, direct access to their
    functionality. This gives you precise control over when and how the tool is
    called.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>As Agent Tools</strong>: Tools can be added to Agent blocks by
    clicking "Add tools" and configuring the required parameters. This allows
    agents to dynamically choose which tools to use based on the context and
    requirements of the task.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Configuration

Each tool requires specific configuration to function properly. Common configuration elements include:

- **API Keys**: Many tools require authentication through API keys
- **Connection Parameters**: Endpoints, database identifiers, etc.
- **Input Formatting**: How data should be structured for the tool
- **Output Handling**: How to process the results from the tool

## Available Tools

Sim Studio provides a diverse collection of tools for various purposes, including:

- **AI and Language Processing**: OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Translation services
- **Search and Research**: Google Search, Tavily, Exa, Perplexity
- **Document Manipulation**: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Notion, Confluence
- **Media Processing**: Vision, Image Generator
- **Communication**: Slack, WhatsApp, Twilio SMS, Gmail
- **Data Storage**: Pinecone, Supabase, Airtable
- **Development**: GitHub

Each tool has its own dedicated documentation page with detailed instructions on configuration and usage.

## Tool Outputs

Tools typically return structured data that can be processed by subsequent blocks in your workflow. The format of this data varies depending on the tool and operation but generally includes:

- The main content or result
- Metadata about the operation
- Status information

Refer to each tool's specific documentation to understand its exact output format.

## YAML Configuration

When using tools in YAML workflows, they follow a consistent structure regardless of whether they're used as standalone blocks or within agent configurations.

### Block Reference Syntax

To reference outputs from previous blocks, use the block name in lowercase with all spaces removed:

- Block name "Agent 1" → reference as `<agent1.content>`
- Block name "Sum Calculator" → reference as `<sumcalculator.result>`
- Block name "Email Sender" → reference as `<emailsender.status>`
- Block name "Data Processor 2" → reference as `<dataprocessor2.output>`

**Special case**: Always reference the starter block as `<start.input>` regardless of its actual name.

### Tool Block Schema

When using a tool as a standalone block:

```yaml
type: object
required:
  - type
  - name
properties:
  type:
    type: string
    description: Tool type identifier (matches the tool name)
  name:
    type: string
    description: Display name for this tool block
  inputs:
    type: object
    description: Tool-specific input parameters
    # Input properties vary by tool - see individual tool documentation
  connections:
    type: object
    properties:
      success:
        type: string
        description: Target block ID for successful execution
      error:
        type: string
        description: Target block ID for error handling
```

### Agent Tool Configuration

When adding tools to an agent block:

```yaml
tools:
  - type: <string>                      # Tool type identifier
    title: <string>                     # Human-readable display name
    toolId: <string>                    # Internal tool identifier
    operation: <string>                 # Tool operation/method name
    usageControl: <string>              # When AI can use it (auto | required | none)
    params: <object>                    # Tool-specific configuration parameters
    isExpanded: <boolean>               # UI state (optional, default: false)
```

### Common Parameters

Most tools share these common configuration patterns:

- **API Keys**: Use environment variable format `{{API_KEY_NAME}}`
- **Endpoints**: URL configurations for service connections
- **Authentication**: Various auth methods (API key, OAuth, etc.)
- **Rate Limits**: Automatic handling of API rate limiting

  <Tab>
    ```yaml
    web-search:
      type: exa
      name: "Web Search"
      inputs:
        query: <start.input>
        num_results: 5
        apiKey: '{{EXA_API_KEY}}'
      connections:

      inputs:
        systemPrompt: "Search for information and provide a summary."
        userPrompt: <start.input>
        model: gpt-4o
        apiKey: '{{OPENAI_API_KEY}}'
        tools:

        userPrompt: <start.input>
        model: gpt-4o
        apiKey: '{{OPENAI_API_KEY}}'
        tools:
          - type: exa

            toolId: gmail_send
            operation: gmail_send
            usageControl: auto
            params:
              credentials: '{{GMAIL_CREDENTIALS}}'
      connections:
        success: next-block
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Tool Usage Control

The `usageControl` parameter determines when and how the AI can use each tool:

- **`auto`**: The AI decides when to use the tool based on context
- **`required`**: The tool must be used during execution
- **`none`**: Tool is available but not suggested to the AI

### Environment Variables

Tools commonly use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```yaml
params:
  apiKey: '{{TOOL_API_KEY}}'        # API authentication key
  endpoint: '{{CUSTOM_ENDPOINT}}'   # Custom service endpoint
  credentials: '{{OAUTH_CREDS}}'    # OAuth or complex credentials
```

For specific tool parameters and configuration options, refer to each tool's individual documentation page.
