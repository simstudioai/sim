A **Persona** in Sim Studio represents a unique AI identity with its own name, description, and optional photo. Personas allow you to define distinct roles, behaviors, and characteristics for agents within your workflows.

## Overview

A Persona is a reusable entity that encapsulates the following attributes:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Name</strong>: The display name of the persona (e.g., "Support Bot", "Research Assistant")
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Description</strong>: A summary of the persona's role, expertise, or intended use
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Photo</strong>: An optional avatar or image representing the persona
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Workspace Association</strong>: Each persona belongs to a specific workspace
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Workflow Assignment</strong>: Personas can be linked to one or more workflows, defining which automations or agents they power
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

When creating or editing a persona, you can configure:

- **Name**: Required. The persona's display name.
- **Description**: Optional. A description of the persona's purpose or expertise.
- **Photo**: Optional. Upload or select an image to visually represent the persona.
- **Workspace**: Required. The workspace this persona belongs to.
- **Workflows**: Assign one or more workflows that this persona will use or control.

## Usage in Workflows

Personas are used to:

- Assign a unique identity to agents in your workflow
- Separate different roles (e.g., "Sales Bot" vs. "Support Bot")
- Enable multi-persona collaboration in complex workflows
- Provide context and branding for end-user interactions

## Example: Creating a Persona

Here's how you might define a persona for a customer support agent:

```yaml
name: Support Bot
description: "Handles customer inquiries and provides support for our products."
photo: "/static/personas/support-bot.png"
workspaceId: workspace-123
workflows:
  - workflow-abc
  - workflow-def
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names and photos to make personas easily recognizable
- Write clear descriptions to help collaborators understand each persona's role
- Assign personas to relevant workflows for better organization and control
