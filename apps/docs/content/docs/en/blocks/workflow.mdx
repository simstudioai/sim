## What It Does

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/blocks/workflow.png'
    alt='Workflow block configuration'
    width={400}
    height={280}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

Drop a Workflow block when you want to call a child workflow as part of a larger flow. The block runs the latest deployed version of that workflow, waits for it to finish, and then continues with the parent.

## Configure It

1. **Pick a workflow** from the dropdown (self-references are blocked to prevent loops).
2. **Map inputs**: If the child workflow has an Input Form trigger, you’ll see each field and can connect parent variables. The mapped values are what the child receives.
3. **Outputs**: After the child finishes, the block exposes:
   - `result` – the child workflow’s final response
   - `success` – whether it ran without errors
   - `error` – message when the run fails

## Execution Notes

- Child workflows run in the same workspace context, so environment variables and tools carry over.
- The block uses deployment versioning: any API, schedule, webhook, manual, or chat execution calls the deployed snapshot. Redeploy the child when you change it.
- If the child fails, the block raises an error unless you handle it downstream.

<Callout>
Keep child workflows focused. Small, reusable flows make it easier to combine them without creating deep nesting.
