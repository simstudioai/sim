Copilot is your in-editor assistant that helps you build and edit workflows with Sim Copilot, as well as understand and improve them. It can:

- **Explain**: Answer questions about Sim and your current workflow
- **Guide**: Suggest edits and best practices
- **Edit**: Make changes to blocks, connections, and settings when you approve

<Callout type="info">
  Copilot is a Sim-managed service. For self-hosted deployments, generate a Copilot API key in the hosted app (sim.ai → Settings → Copilot)
  1. Go to [sim.ai](https://sim.ai) → Settings → Copilot and generate a Copilot API key
  2. Set `COPILOT_API_KEY` in your self-hosted environment to that value
</Callout>

## Context Menu (@)

Use the `@` symbol to reference various resources and give Copilot more context about your workspace:

  alt="Copilot context menu showing available reference options"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

The `@` menu provides access to:
- **Chats**: Reference previous copilot conversations
- **All workflows**: Reference any workflow in your workspace
- **Workflow Blocks**: Reference specific blocks from workflows
- **Blocks**: Reference block types and templates
- **Knowledge**: Reference your uploaded documents and knowledgebase
- **Docs**: Reference Sim documentation
- **Templates**: Reference workflow templates
- **Logs**: Reference execution logs and results

This contextual information helps Copilot provide more accurate and relevant assistance for your specific use case.

### Mode Selection Interface

You can easily switch between different reasoning modes using the mode selector in the Copilot interface:

<Image
  src="/static/copilot/copilot-models.png"
  alt="Copilot mode selection showing Advanced mode with MAX toggle"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

The interface allows you to:
- **Select reasoning level**: Choose from Fast, Auto, Advanced, or Behemoth
- **Enable MAX mode**: Toggle for maximum reasoning capabilities when you need the most thorough analysis
- **See mode descriptions**: Understand what each mode is optimized for

Choose your mode based on the complexity of your task - use Fast for simple questions and Behemoth for complex architectural changes.

## Billing and Cost Calculation

### How Costs Are Calculated

Copilot usage is billed per token from the underlying LLM:

- **Input tokens**: billed at the provider's base rate (**at-cost**)
- **Output tokens**: billed at **1.5×** the provider's base output rate

```javascript
copilotCost = (inputTokens × inputPrice + outputTokens × (outputPrice × 1.5)) / 1,000,000
```

| Component | Rate Applied         |
|----------|----------------------|
| Input    | inputPrice           |
| Output   | outputPrice × 1.5    |

<Callout type="warning">
  Pricing shown reflects rates as of September 4, 2025. Check provider documentation for current pricing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Model prices are per million tokens. The calculation divides by 1,000,000 to get the actual cost. See <a href="/execution/costs">the Cost Calculation page</a> for background and examples.
