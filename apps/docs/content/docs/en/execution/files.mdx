Sim makes it easy to work with files throughout your workflows. Blocks can receive files, process them, and pass them to other blocks seamlessly.

## File Objects

When blocks output files (like Gmail attachments, generated images, or parsed documents), they return a standardized file object:

```json
{
  "name": "report.pdf",
  "url": "https://...",
  "base64": "JVBERi0xLjQK...",
  "type": "application/pdf",
  "size": 245678
}
```

You can access any of these properties when referencing files from previous blocks.

## Passing Files Between Blocks

Reference files from previous blocks using the tag dropdown. Click in any file input field and type `<` to see available outputs.

**Common patterns:**

```
// Single file from a block
<gmail.attachments[0]>

// Pass the whole file object
<file_parser.files[0]>

// Access specific properties
<gmail.attachments[0].name>
<gmail.attachments[0].base64>
```

Most blocks accept the full file object and extract what they need automatically. You don't need to manually extract `base64` or `url` in most cases.

## Triggering Workflows with Files

When calling a workflow via API that expects file input, include files in your request:

<Tabs items={['Base64', 'URL']}>
  <Tab value="Base64">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sim.ai/api/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID/execute" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "document": {
          "name": "report.pdf",
          "base64": "JVBERi0xLjQK...",
          "type": "application/pdf"
        }
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="URL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://sim.ai/api/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID/execute" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "document": {
          "name": "report.pdf",
          "url": "https://example.com/report.pdf",
          "type": "application/pdf"
        }
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The workflow's Start block should have an input field configured to receive the file parameter.

## Receiving Files in API Responses

When a workflow outputs files, they're included in the response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "output": {
    "generatedFile": {
      "name": "output.png",
      "url": "https://...",
      "base64": "iVBORw0KGgo...",
      "type": "image/png",
      "size": 34567
    }
  }
}
```

Use `url` for direct downloads or `base64` for inline processing.

## Blocks That Work with Files

**File inputs:**
- **File** - Parse documents, images, and text files
- **Vision** - Analyze images with AI models
- **Mistral Parser** - Extract text from PDFs

**File outputs:**
- **Gmail** - Email attachments
- **Slack** - Downloaded files
- **TTS** - Generated audio files
- **Video Generator** - Generated videos
- **Image Generator** - Generated images

**File storage:**
- **Supabase** - Upload/download from storage
- **S3** - AWS S3 operations
- **Google Drive** - Drive file operations
- **Dropbox** - Dropbox file operations

<Callout type="info">
  Files are automatically available to downstream blocks. The execution engine handles all file transfer and format conversion.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Use file objects directly** - Pass the full file object rather than extracting individual properties. Blocks handle the conversion automatically.

2. **Check file types** - Ensure the file type matches what the receiving block expects. The Vision block needs images, the File block handles documents.

3. **Consider file size** - Large files increase execution time. For very large files, consider using storage blocks (S3, Supabase) for intermediate storage.
