description: Start a workflow from a chat deployment

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'
import { Image } from '@/components/ui/image'

## Overview

The Chat trigger creates a conversational interface for your workflow. Deploy your workflow as a chat and users can interact with it through a shareable URL. Each message starts a new workflow execution using your latest deployment.

## Runtime Outputs

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/triggers/chat-trigger-light.png'
    alt='Chat deployment conversation'
    width={400}
    height={250}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

The trigger writes three fields that downstream blocks can reference:

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `<chat.input>` | Latest user message |
| `<chat.conversationId>` | Conversation thread ID |
| `<chat.files>` | Optional uploaded files |

Files include `name`, `mimeType`, and a signed download `url`.

## Usage Notes

1. Add one Chat Trigger block per workflow.
2. Deploy the workflow in chat mode.
3. Share the deployment linkâ€”every reply reuses the conversation ID so the workflow can keep context.

<Callout type="info">
The builder blocks multiple Chat Trigger blocks in the same workflow.
</Callout>
