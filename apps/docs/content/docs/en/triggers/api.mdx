title: API Trigger
description: Start a workflow from an authenticated HTTP request
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'
import { Image } from '@/components/ui/image'

## Overview

The API trigger exposes your workflow as a secure HTTP endpoint. Send JSON data to the endpoint and your workflow processes it immediately. API calls always execute against your latest deployment.

## Configure Input Format

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/triggers/api-trigger-light.png'
    alt='API trigger input format'
    width={400}
    height={250}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

Add an **Input Format** field for each parameter. Runtime output keys mirror the schema and are also available under `<api.input>`.

Manual runs in the editor use the `value` column so you can test without sending a request. During execution the resolver populates both `<api.userId>` and `<api.input.userId>`.

## Request Example

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://sim.ai/api/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/execute \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY' \
  -d '{"userId":"demo-user","maxTokens":1024}'
```

Successful responses return the serialized execution result from the Executor. Errors surface validation, auth, or workflow failures.

## Output Reference

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `<api.field>` | Field defined in the Input Format |
| `<api.input>` | Entire structured request body |

If no Input Format is defined, the executor exposes the raw JSON at `<api.input>` only.

<Callout type="warning">
A workflow can contain only one API Trigger. Publish a new deployment after changes so the endpoint stays up to date.
</Callout>
