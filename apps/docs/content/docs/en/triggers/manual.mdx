title: Manual Trigger
description: Run a workflow on demand without inputs

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'
import { Image } from '@/components/ui/image'

## Overview

The Manual trigger adds a simple Run button to the top of your workflow. Use it when you want to execute the workflow immediately without collecting extra data.

## How It Works

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/triggers/manual-run-light.png'
    alt='Manual trigger run button'
    width={400}
    height={250}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

- Launches the workflow using the active deployment snapshot
- Sends no payload—downstream blocks only see what they already have configured
- Perfect for quick sanity checks, smoke tests, or flows that only rely on internal variables

## When to Use

- Kick off a workflow after publishing a new deployment to confirm everything still works
- Run maintenance jobs that don’t require external input
- Trigger child workflows that read state or environment variables only

## Compared to Input Form

Need structured values or type validation at runtime? Switch to an Input Form trigger instead—the run panel will collect those fields before the workflow starts.

<Callout>
Manual trigger runs don’t override your deployment history. Update and redeploy whenever canvas changes need to go live.
