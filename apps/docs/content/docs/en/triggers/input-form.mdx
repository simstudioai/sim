## Overview

Use an Input Form trigger when a workflow should start from the editor with typed fields. The run panel shows exactly the fields you define, so the workflow always receives clean data.

## What You Define

Add fields in the Input Format builder (text, number, boolean, JSON, etc.). For each field:

- The value appears as `<blockName.field>` in the workflow.
- The full payload is mirrored at `<blockName.input>` for convenience.

If you leave the form empty, the trigger has no outputs.

## Manual Runs

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/triggers/input-form-panel-light.png'
    alt='Input form run panel'
    width={400}
    height={250}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

When you press Run in the editor, the panel renders the form. Submitted values feed directly into the trigger output, so downstream blocks can reference them without extra parsing. Numbers are cast to numbers, booleans become true/false, and JSON fields are parsed before the workflow sees them.

## Child Workflows

<div className='flex justify-center my-6'>
  <Image
    src='/static/triggers/workflow-input-mapping-light.png'
    alt='Workflow input mapping'
    width={400}
    height={250}
    className='rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm'
  />
</div>

Input Form triggers also power the Workflow block. When you embed a child workflow, the mapping step shows the child form fields so you can connect variables from the parent. Whatever you map becomes the child workflowâ€™s Input Form submission.
