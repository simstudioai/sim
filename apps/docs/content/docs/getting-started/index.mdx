## Your First Workflow: Research Assistant

We'll build a workflow that:
1. Takes a research question from a user
2. Searches the web for relevant information
3. Summarizes the findings with an AI model
4. Returns a helpful response

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    Open Sim Studio and click "New Workflow" in the dashboard. Give it a name like "Research Assistant".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the starting block">
    Every workflow needs a **Starter Block** - it's the entry point that receives input from users. It's automatically added to new workflows.
    
    Click on the Starter Block and configure it:
    - **Input Type**: Text
    - **Label**: "Research Question"
    - **Placeholder**: "What would you like to research?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a web search tool">
    Drag a **Perplexity Tool** from the sidebar onto the canvas. This will search the web for information.
    
    Configure the Perplexity Tool:
    - **Query**: Connect this to the output of your Starter Block
    - **API Key**: Add your Perplexity API key (or use the demo key)
    
    Connect the Starter Block to the Perplexity Tool by dragging from the output port to the input port.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an AI agent">
    Drag an **Agent Block** onto the canvas. This will summarize the search results.
    
    Configure the Agent Block:
    - **Model**: Choose "OpenAI GPT-4" (or your preferred model)
    - **System Prompt**: "You are a research assistant. Summarize the provided information in a clear, concise manner."
    - **User Message**: Connect this to the output of the Perplexity Tool
    
    Connect the Perplexity Tool to the Agent Block.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a response block">
    Drag a **Response Block** onto the canvas. This formats the final output.
    
    Configure the Response Block:
    - **Content**: Connect this to the output of the Agent Block
    - **Content Type**: "Text"
    
    Connect the Agent Block to the Response Block.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your workflow">
    Click the "Test" button in the toolbar. Enter a research question like "What are the latest developments in AI?" and click "Run".
    
    You should see your workflow execute step by step, with the final output being a summarized research response.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Just Built

Congratulations! You've created a working AI research assistant that:
- ✅ Takes user input
- ✅ Searches the web for information
- ✅ Processes results with AI
- ✅ Returns a formatted response

## Understanding the Components

### Blocks You Used

<Files>
  <File
    name="Starter Block"
    icon={<ConnectIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
    annotation="Entry point for user input"
  />
  <File
    name="Perplexity Tool"
    icon={<PerplexityIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
    annotation="Web search and information retrieval"
  />
  <File
    name="Agent Block"
    icon={<AgentIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
    annotation="AI model for processing and summarization"
  />
  <File
    name="Response Block"
    icon={<ApiIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
    annotation="Format and return final output"
  />
</Files>

### Key Concepts

**Connections**: The lines between blocks represent data flow. Output from one block becomes input to the next.

**Configuration**: Each block has settings that control its behavior. Always check the right panel when you select a block.

**Execution**: Workflows run from left to right, following the connections you've made.

## Next Steps

Now that you've built your first workflow, here are some ideas to expand it:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Add Conditions" href="/blocks/condition">
    Branch your workflow based on the type of question asked
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use More Tools" href="/tools">
    Integrate with Gmail, Slack, or Notion
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add Functions" href="/blocks/function">
    Use custom JavaScript for data processing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy Your Workflow" href="/execution">
    Turn your workflow into a live API
  </Card>
</Cards>
