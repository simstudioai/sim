Sim Studio is a visual workflow builder that lets you create AI-powered applications by connecting blocks on a canvas. Instead of writing code, you drag and drop components to build everything from chatbots to complex automation workflows.

Think of it like a combination of Zapier's visual interface and GitHub Actions' power, but specifically designed for AI workflows. You can connect multiple AI models, integrate with 60+ services, and deploy production-ready applicationsâ€”all without writing a single line of code.

## How It Works

You build workflows by connecting different types of blocks:

### Core Blocks
- **Agent** - Chat with AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models)
- **API** - Connect to any REST endpoint or service
- **Function** - Run custom JavaScript when you need it
- **Condition** - Branch your workflow based on data or responses
- **Router** - Direct users to different paths based on input
- **Evaluator** - Check if outputs meet your criteria

### Ready-Made Tools
Over 60 integrations work out of the box:
- **Communication**: Gmail, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp
- **Data**: Notion, Google Sheets, Airtable, Supabase
- **AI**: OpenAI, Perplexity, Hugging Face, ElevenLabs
- **Web**: Firecrawl, Google Search, browser automation

## What You Can Build

**AI Assistants**: Create chatbots that can search the web, check your calendar, and send emails.

**Content Workflows**: Generate blog posts, social media content, or marketing materials using multiple AI models.

**Data Processing**: Extract information from documents, analyze data, and generate reports.

**Automation**: Build workflows that trigger actions based on events from your tools and services.

**API Orchestration**: Combine multiple services into a single, powerful API endpoint.

## Why Choose Sim Studio

**No Vendor Lock-in**: Switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models) without rebuilding your workflows.

**Real-time Collaboration**: Work with your team on the same workflow simultaneously, like Google Docs but for AI development.

**Production Ready**: Built-in error handling, logging, and monitoring mean your workflows can handle real users from day one.

**Local Development**: Test with local models via Ollama, then deploy with cloud providers when ready.
