Tags provide a powerful way to organize your documents and create precise filtering for your vector searches. By combining tag-based filtering with semantic search, you can retrieve exactly the content you need from your knowledgebase.

## Adding Tags to Documents

You can add custom tags to any document in your knowledgebase to organize and categorize your content for easier retrieval.

### Tag Management
- **Custom tags**: Create your own tag system that fits your workflow
- **Multiple tags per document**: Apply as many tags as needed to each document
- **Tag organization**: Group related documents with consistent tagging
- **Bulk tagging**: Apply tags to multiple documents at once

### Tag Best Practices
- **Consistent naming**: Use standardized tag names across your documents
- **Hierarchical tags**: Consider using prefixes like "topic:", "project:", "type:"
- **Descriptive tags**: Use clear, meaningful tag names
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove unused or outdated tags periodically

## Using Tags in Knowledge Blocks

Tags become powerful when combined with the Knowledge block in your workflows. You can filter your searches to specific tagged content, ensuring your AI agents get the most relevant information.

## Search Modes

The Knowledge block supports three different search modes depending on what you provide:

### 1. Tag-Only Search
When you **only provide tags** (no search query):
- **Direct retrieval**: Fetches all documents that have the specified tags
- **No vector search**: Results are based purely on tag matching
- **Fast performance**: Quick retrieval without semantic processing
- **Exact matching**: Only documents with all specified tags are returned

**Use case**: When you need all documents from a specific category or project

### 2. Vector Search Only
When you **only provide a search query** (no tags):
- **Semantic search**: Finds content based on meaning and context
- **Full knowledgebase**: Searches across all documents
- **Relevance ranking**: Results ordered by semantic similarity
- **Natural language**: Use questions or phrases to find relevant content

**Use case**: When you need the most relevant content regardless of organization

### 3. Combined Tag Filtering + Vector Search
When you **provide both tags and a search query**:
1. **First**: Filter documents to only those with the specified tags
2. **Then**: Perform vector search within that filtered subset
3. **Result**: Semantically relevant content from your tagged documents only

**Use case**: When you need relevant content from a specific category or project

### Search Configuration

#### Tag Filtering
- **Multiple tags**: Use comma-separated tags for AND logic (document must have all tags)
- **Tag combinations**: Mix different tag types for precise filtering
- **Case sensitivity**: Tag matching is case-insensitive
- **Partial matching**: Exact tag name matching required

#### Vector Search Parameters
- **Query complexity**: Natural language questions work best
- **Result limits**: Configure how many chunks to retrieve
- **Relevance threshold**: Set minimum similarity scores
- **Context window**: Adjust chunk size for your use case

## Advanced Filtering Strategies

### Project-Based Organization
```
Tags: "project:alpha", "status:complete", "type:requirements"
Query: "What are the main user features?"
```
This finds feature-related content specifically from completed Project Alpha requirements.

### Topic Categorization
```
Tags: "topic:machine-learning", "level:advanced"
Query: "neural network optimization techniques"
```
This searches for optimization techniques within advanced machine learning content only.

### Temporal Organization
```
Tags: "quarter:q4-2024", "department:engineering"
Query: "performance metrics and goals"
```
This finds performance-related content from Q4 2024 engineering documents.

### Content Type Filtering
```
Tags: "type:manual", "product:api"
Query: "authentication setup process"
```
This searches for authentication setup information within API manual content.

## Tag Management Features

### Tag Creation
- **Dynamic creation**: Tags are created automatically when first used
- **Bulk operations**: Apply the same tags to multiple documents
- **Import with tags**: Add tags during document upload process
- **Template tagging**: Create tag templates for consistent organization

### Tag Organization
- **Tag suggestions**: System suggests relevant tags based on content
- **Tag hierarchy**: Organize tags in logical groupings
- **Usage analytics**: See which tags are most commonly used
- **Tag cleanup**: Remove unused tags to keep your system organized

### Search History
- **Query patterns**: Track common tag + search combinations
- **Performance insights**: See which searches return the best results
- **Optimization suggestions**: Improve your tagging strategy over time

## Integration with Workflows

### Knowledge Block Configuration
1. **Select knowledgebase**: Choose which knowledgebase to search
2. **Add tags**: Specify filtering tags (optional)
3. **Enter query**: Add your search query (optional)
4. **Configure results**: Set number of chunks to retrieve
5. **Test search**: Preview results before using in workflow

### Dynamic Tag Usage
- **Variable tags**: Use workflow variables as tag values
- **Conditional filtering**: Apply different tags based on workflow logic
- **Context-aware search**: Adjust tags based on conversation context
- **Multi-step filtering**: Refine searches through workflow steps

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient filtering**: Tag filtering happens before vector search for better performance
- **Caching**: Frequently used tag combinations are cached for speed
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple tag searches can run simultaneously
- **Resource management**: Automatic optimization of search resources

## Getting Started with Tags

1. **Plan your tag structure**: Decide on consistent naming conventions
2. **Start tagging**: Add relevant tags to your existing documents
3. **Test combinations**: Experiment with tag + search query combinations
4. **Integrate into workflows**: Use the Knowledge block with your tagging strategy
5. **Refine over time**: Adjust your tagging approach based on search results

Tags transform your knowledgebase from a simple document store into a precisely organized, searchable intelligence system that your AI workflows can navigate with surgical precision.
