# Tools

Tools in Sim Studio are the functional components that power your agentic workflows. Each tool provides specific capabilities that can be integrated into your workflows.

## Available Tools

This section contains documentation for all available tools in Sim Studio. Each tool page provides:

- Tool description and purpose
- Configuration parameters
- Input and output specifications
- Example usage

You can use the navigation menu to browse through all available tools or search for specific tools by name or category.

## Tool Categories

Tools are organized by category:

- **AI Services**: Tools that integrate with AI models and services (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.)
- **Data Processing**: Tools that transform, store, or retrieve data
- **External APIs**: Tools that connect to external services and APIs
- **Communication**: Tools for messaging and notifications
- **Utilities**: Tools for file handling, web browsing, and other utility functions

## Using Tools in Workflows

Tools are used as blocks in your workflow diagrams. To add a tool:

1. Drag a tool block from the sidebar into your workflow
2. Configure the tool's parameters
3. Connect the tool to other blocks in your workflow

Each tool has specific input requirements and produces outputs that can be used by downstream blocks in your workflow.

## Custom Tools

If you need functionality not provided by the built-in tools, you can create custom tools using the Function block or by developing a custom block implementation.
